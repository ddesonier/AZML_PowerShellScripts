# Get-AzMLDataCatalogModels
### Function Overview
The `Get-ModelsInfoByModelName` function queries an Azure Machine Learning registry to retrieve details about models. It takes three mandatory parameters:

1. `$ResourceGroup`: Specifies the Azure resource group where the registry is located.
2. `$Registry`: Specifies the name of the Azure Machine Learning registry.
3. `$ModelArray`: An array containing model names to query.

### Function Steps
1. Retrieves a list of models from the specified registry.
2. For each model:
    - If a "latest version" exists, retrieves detailed information using the `az ml model show` command.
    - If no version information is available, adds the model to the investigation list.
3. Writes the model information to a CSV file named `models_<timestamp>.csv`.
4. Writes the investigation list to a CSV file named `investigate_<timestamp>.csv`.
